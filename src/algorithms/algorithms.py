    Apply a bias correction algorithm to a dataset and display pre- and post-correction assessment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset :
        Original dataset object containing features, targets, and sensitive attributes.
    learning_settings :
        Dictionary containing learning settings.
    algorithm :
        Bias correction algorithm to be applied. It should accept 'dataset', 'sensitive_attribute',
        and 'learning_settings'
        as parameters.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        - If an invalid dataset is provided.
        - If the dataset does not contain both features and targets.
        - If the sensitive attribute is not present in the dataset.
        - If the provided algorithm is not a callable function.
        - If the provided algorithm does not receive the correct parameters.
